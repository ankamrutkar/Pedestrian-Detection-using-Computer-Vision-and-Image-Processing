# Pedestrian-Detection-using-Computer-Vision-and-Image-Processing
Pedestrian detection is a critical task in computer vision, especially for applications such as autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, and smart traffic control. This project presents a simple yet effective pedestrian detection system using pre-trained models and OpenCV in Python. The system utilizes the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) descriptor in combination with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to detect pedestrians in real-time video streams. The accuracy of the detection depends on several factors such as image resolution, lighting conditions, and occlusions. The proposed system is lightweight, easy to implement, and demonstrates the basic concept of object detection in AI.
